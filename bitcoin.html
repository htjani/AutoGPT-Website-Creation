<h1>Bitcoin</h1>
<p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin is unique in that there are a finite number of them: 21 million.</p>
<p>Proof of Work: Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to validate transactions and create new blocks. This involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the problem is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins.</p>
<p>Token Issuing Schedule: The issuance of new bitcoins is decentralized and is carried out by the network. The issuance rate is set in the code, so miners cannot cheat the system or create bitcoins out of thin air. The issuance rate is halved every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.</p>
<p>Advantages of Bitcoin: Bitcoin has several advantages over fiat currency and gold as money. It is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It is also transparent, meaning that all transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be viewed by anyone. Finally, it is secure, as transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography.</p>

<p>Bitcoin mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions or blockchain. This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Wallets</h2>
<p>A Bitcoin wallet is a software program in which Bitcoins are stored. Wallets provide a handy way to keep track of all of a user's public and private addresses. Because addresses are pseudo-anonymous, anyone can have as many addresses as they want.</p>
