    <h1>Ethereum</h1><p>Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Development was crowdfunded in 2014, and the network went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins premined.</p><p>Some of the advantages of Ethereum include its ability to support smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Ethereum also has faster transaction times and lower fees than Bitcoin. However, there are also some disadvantages to Ethereum, such as its scalability issues and the potential for smart contract bugs.</p></body></html>
